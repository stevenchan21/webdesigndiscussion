             <p><Strong>Best Denki</Strong> was founded in Japan in 1953. They started off as a warehouse business offering electrical products from around the world. Today, it has one of the biggest network of chain
             stores in Japan. They have also extended their business to Asia. In 1985, they have established themsevles as the first electrical and electronic store in Singapore that offers the widest range of household
             products. In 2004, the business was so successful that they decided to have their headquarters for overseas operationsn in Singapore. Best Denki is the first large electronic and electrical store that
             provide customers with a hands-on experience of the display products service </p>
             <p><Strong>Purpose of its website</Strong> Like Courts, the purpose of this website is to allow customer to seamlessly purchase electrical and electronic products online without the hassle of going to
             the store. Through the use of web development technology, it is able to extend its service and offer their customer products online and by doing so to enhance their quality of life and lifestyle.
             The website is also to reach out to its customer so as to advise promotions and all the products that are available on sales. It will be convenient for the customers, if they can find details such
             as locations of its outlets, and contacting Best Denki on any enquiries.
             <p><Strong>Target Audience</Strong> Best Denki website intended audiences are customers who have a preference to make purchases online and get it delivered to their homes. As these days, E-commerce
             users are growing and it is the trend to buy things online. The target group are usually those IT gadgets fanantics and people who are in need of home electronic appliances. The age group that uses</p>

         </div>
         <div class="content textjustify col-xs-12 col-md-5">
             <p>such a service comes mostly from the age range between 20 years old to 50 years old. They are usually the working adults and spent most of their time at work and will not have much time to go shopping.
             Since Best Denki can even do delivery specifically during night hours, it is most convenient for such target group. While men are naturally attracted to electronic products, Best Denki also offers beauty
             care electronic products such as hair remover, hair straightner online in a bid to attract the ladies. However and presumely, most of these consumers are likely to be men as they tend to have the mentality
             to get things through the most convenient way of transactions.</p>
             <p><Strong>Accuracy</Strong> The items that Best Denki are selling are quite update to date and accurate. There are no signs of expired news, items or information. They even advised if the particular item
             is only available at certain stores. On the minus point, some of the subcategory, may have no items on display. It may not be nice to provide a subcatory for the user there is no items in it. This could be
             a reason that perhaps previously there are items available but are no longer in stock which the fastest way of updating is to take out the item from the website. And it will be more efficient to add on if
             there is an new item that becomes available under the specific subcategory.
             <p><Strong>Credibility</Strong> The website was created in 2011 and has been successfully in servicing hundreds or thousands of customers on a daily basis since. All the website images are sharp and clear
             to see. It is never to difficult to understand the service that the website is trying to offer at first glance. The information conveyed through the website are very explicit.</p>

                there is a filter feature when one has clicked into the subcategory. This allows you to filter by the sub-sub category and also by the brand. Futhermore, it has embedded with a search feature where
                one can easily find the item with keywords.</p>

            <div class="tab-pane margin-top fade" id="visual">
                <p>This is definitely one of the better electronic websites than the others. The outlook is fresh and sharp, and it never came close to looking complicated despite so many products that the website
                are selling. The website is very sucessful in digesting a complicated system into a simple yet still able to display a good standard level of visual outlook. The carousel stretches to the same width of
                navigation bar provides a better visual outlook. While advertising news, it beautify the website at the same time which is a win win situation and a plus point.</p>

            <div class="tab-pane margin-top fade" id="layout">
                <p>Despite the top that gives you a feeling of being out of place, it is not argubly wrong to have this kind of layout. Most of the time the login button is located at the top right hand corner and
                logo is on the extreme right side. This website is exactly the opposite of that. The reason why the logo should be on the right is because, human eyes scan from left to right and it usually register
                the first thing they saw. For advertising the company, it is important that the users know the company before anything else. Still it is a unique way to display on the opposite end, as in general,
                human eyes read from top to bottom, hence it is no big issue that the logo is located on the right. And instead, the different way of doing this could catch the user's attention. Otherwise, all the
                elements are very well organized and everything is well aligned. This website depicts a very neat and clean outlook through the placing and organizing of its elements.</p>

            <div class="tab-pane margin-top fade" id="readability">
                <p>The website mostly uses 14 pixels and the font style of arial on its content. With the help of bold, caption and short wordings, it allows user to have a better readability than most sites. The images are
                define and they have limit the number of items displayed on the homepage which has made the website easier to look at. Some of the wordings where it most concerns the customer such as pricing has much
                bigger fonts. This helps the user efficiently when reading the contents of the website. </p>

            <div class="tab-pane margin-top fade" id="loading">
                <p>The loading speed for most of the pages has a record of 1 to 1.5 seconds which is very impressive. This will give an advantage over other E-commerce websites as it is faster to browse around and
                have almost no waiting time. Humans are naturally impatient and with a loading speed so fast, it certainly entice the users to have a preference to their website.</p>

            <div class="tab-pane margin-top fade" id="color">
                <p>The primary color use of this website is the corporate red color. This is a golden rule for web designing. With the addition of a little gradient color (a good mix of white and red) has a good
                effect in making the website looks lively. The white color wording on the red or black background color is a good choice. It is easier for the user to read and is compatible with the two bkacground
                colors used.</p>

            <div class="tab-pane margin-top fade" id="improvement">
                <p>In order to beef up the contents, Challenger could consider taking this website further and tranforming it into a ecommerce operation. In this case, there will be more contents and images to load into the website
                and this helps to decorate the website from its simplicity outlook. The font size should definitely increase slightly to give a better visualization for the user to read, or perhaps it could consider
                changing the font style. While the main colors used in the website is most appropriate, adding new colors to the website can be quite difficult to suggest as the colors that are compatible to the
                corporate colours are limited. Perhaps a lighter blue or black color could match up with the corporate colours.</p>
