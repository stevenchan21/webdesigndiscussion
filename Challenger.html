             <p><Strong>Challenger</Strong> has been operating in Singapore for 34 years and has been well establised as a IT retailer. It has many valueClub member in Singapore, a membership that offers consumers
             with discounted price and enjoy certain privileges. Over the course of 34 years, Challenger has rapidly expanded to about 34 shops country wide. In Singapore, it has been recognized as a market leader in
             the IT retail environment.</p>
             <p><Strong>Purpose of its website</Strong> As a market leader in IT retail environment, there is no surprise that Challenger has adopted web development technology and it uses the website as a means of
             providing users with events updates and promotions. The website allows users to create their account so as to track their membership rewards and privileges. Essentially, the website provides user with
             self-help knowledge where they can find useful information to address their problems or enquiries without the need to call the hotlines
             or making a trip to the nearest branch. Otherwise, like most standard service industry websites, the website serves to provide user with each outlet details such as the address and the operating hours.
             <p><Strong>Target Audience</Strong> Challenger's website intended audiences are mainly the consumers of IT electronic items and especially those who already has its membership. The people tend to
             access this website are those that wanted to find out any latest promotions or events like fair to attend.</p>

         </div>
         <div class="content textjustify col-xs-12 col-md-5">
             <p>Also, people who wanted to find out the nearest branch from their locations could also use this
             website to gain information. In order to reduce the number of customers seeking for help, the website has been built to serve this purpose.</p>
             <p><Strong>Accuracy</Strong> The contents of the website are mostly well updated to the latest information. There are no signs of any events or promotions that has been expired or too advance. All the outlets information
             are up to date and accurate. However, there is a misleading indication on the brand catalogue where it stated "New", while the date published is on November 2015. Although, it is the latest brand catalogue,
             it should not in anyway be considered New as the period between November 2015 and the present date is never close. Futhermore, although the website has display their top partnerships with other vendors, it could
             better informe its customers on the exact brands they are selling.
             <p><Strong>Credibility</Strong> The Challenger website has been fairly succcessful, considering it has thousands and thousands of members in the country while maintaning its stability to support these users on their
             everyday access to the site. It has made good effort to get most of the contents updated across all pages on a regular basis. On the catalogue page, Challenger has delivered a unique way of displaying their products.
             Instead of uploading numerous images of products on the website, it has displayed in a pdf format with animation to give the user the feeling of flipping like a magazine. In this way, it definitely helps in the loading
             speed while still able to show pictures of products in a fanciful way. </p>

                <p>There are not many contents that sits in the website, therefore, it is considered fairly easy to navigate around.
                However, if one were to search for the product catalogue, it may not be as easy as a straightforward click but still it is not too difficult to find it.
                From the navigation bar on the homepage, one can simply find almost every links from that section. Unless you are searching for a promotion status of a
                specific product, one can find it tedious to scroll through the promotion page. The website has structured in a way it wanted the user to scroll through the
                list of promotions items so that one could get noticed of something else. Nevertheless, a search function is definitely a good add-on to serve a fussy customer.
                The store page, which has a long list of outlets details may take user a bit of time to scroll down, it could be made more convenience if there
                is a widget on the side which allows user to click on the name that directs to the details within the same page.</p>

            <div class="tab-pane margin-top fade" id="visual">
                <p>The visual appeal of the website is pretty dull perhaps due to the corporate color. The idea of the carousel does catch the user's attention, with the promotion
                display spinning off in style. Unfortunately that is as much as it gets, the website in perception looks simple and nothing extraordinary. Perhaps, there is limited images on display to
                bring life to the website. The website may have updated contents but the outlook gives the user that the website is on the verge of being abandon soon with the plain outlook.</p>

                <p>The placement of the elements and positioning are great. The whole website looks very clean and well organized. From the header to body and to footer, everything is well aligned. Even the contents within
                each section of the page are well organized. The website is very consistent, with the login section, the header and the footer having the same standard across all its pages.</p>

            <div class="tab-pane margin-top fade" id="readability">
                <p>Most of the contents have a font size too small and may strain the eyes of some elderly users. The font size used in most of the content is 12 pixels with font style of Helvetica Neue. This sizing may seems
                seems approriate for standard documents in microsoft words but the font size used may not be a good match with the font style which in turn makes the wording looks smaller than usual standard.</p>

            <div class="tab-pane margin-top fade" id="loading">
                <p>The loading speed of most of the pages are quite fast and lives well within most users' expections. As mentioned above the average standard of a human tolerance of loading a page is about
                3 or 4 seconds these days and the site has a good record of getting loaded within 2 seconds. There is only a few pages like the one under "Top Partners" going into "Valore", which takes about 4 seconds
                to load, still it is considered within the expectation of a normal user.</p>

            <div class="tab-pane margin-top fade" id="color">
                <p>The website takes credit from the consistent use of corporate colors. However, these colors has inevitably made the website looks dull. The additional colors used for example, the event calendar
                are too contrast with the corporate colors and may seems incompatible. Under promotions, the colors used to display for each item's promotion is outstanding and definitely catches the user's eyes, however,
                it does not go well with the whole website corporate colors. The grey color used on the wordings for most contents is a good idea. Most importantly, it does not hurt the eye of the user with its
                dim color and it certainly matches up with the two corporate colors namely, navy blue and orange.</p>

                <p>The website could enhance its visual appearance through having simpler yet conceptualized design of banners. The logo could follow the best practice of positioning it on the left.</p>
