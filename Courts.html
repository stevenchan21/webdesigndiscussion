                <p>While there are many contents in the website, it is not difficult at all to navigate around and the desired information. As it is a website for online purchase, the focus will be on
                finding the products. Courts website has been very successfully where they have implemented search by category for the items if on top of that, its has embedded a search function that
                allows the user to search by key words. Hence navigating to the correct items never seems tought on this website. Otherwise, for other enquiries, there is a sitemap at the footer where
                one can easily find what they are looking for.</p>

            <div class="tab-pane margin-top fade" id="visual">
                <p>The visual appeal of the website is fairly average. Although it comes with ease on the usage and navigation, the homepage is overloaded with product items. There are too many images involved,
                which makes the website looks complex on first glance. In fact the website is not complicated at all. Unlike the Challenger website, this website does show a bit of life that catches the attention of the user.
                It is made for operational purposes, hence their focusing point is the sales of products and its user experience rather than the outlook of the website. Some of the products images are not crop properly and
                the resolution maybe poor.</p>

            <div class="tab-pane margin-top fade" id="layout">
                <p>The layout is considered decent as there are grid lines over each item displayed. And the items are well organized and aligned with the categories. The search bar are stick on top of the screen
                where it does not obstruct user view the products at the same time it serves as a convenient for user to find items using keywords. On a small note, the latest promotions has been noticed to be positioned
                at the bottom where it should actually be places somewhere on top of the homepage for users to catch it at first glance.</p>

            <div class="tab-pane margin-top fade" id="readability">
                <p>The website is most impressive that the font use on most contents especially on the specifications is only 10px but it is not hard to read at all. Perhaps due to the letters in Caption, it makes the font more
                readable. The use of font style is 'Open Sans' and this is a standard font style which also helps in visualizing.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane margin-top fade" id="loading">
                <p>Most of the time the website takes about 2 seconds to load up the page which is satisfactory. This is should be given more credit, as the site has so many contents to manage and still able to keeup
                with a good loadding speed.</p>

            <div class="tab-pane margin-top fade" id="color">
                <p>The Use of color standard is slightly above average. On most pages, there is a good standard of two standout colors namely yellow and blue which are also aligned with their corporate colors.
                However, on the homepage especially the automatic sliding pages, there are too many colors used and although it brings life to the website, it creates a contrast and looks a bit messy. Perhaps that is
                the company's intention to show there are many products they support and making it look afforable than having a classy look.</p>

            <div class="tab-pane margin-top fade" id="improvement">
                <p>Usability wise, this website can be considered as a decent site. However, there is room for improvement on the color use for the homepage and it can be pleasing for the eyes of the user if the
                homepage is less filled with so many products.</p>
