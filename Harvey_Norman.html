                <p>The website has excellent navigation espcially when it comes to searching for a product. It has a search engine built into the website, the categorized items from the Browse Products
                dropdown are clear and easy to look for items. In addition, it allows the user to filter by brands, product type and cost budget. There is also a sort by items from the Newest to the oldest.
                However, the login to the user account should be made more obvious. In this website, the login page is linked with the word "Account" from the homepage and is grouped together with other elements
                which some people may overlook and therefore have the difficulty navigating to the login page.</p>

                <p>The homepage of the website looks lively, however it seems to have many colours. From the first look, the website looks abit messy maybe because of the overwhelming colours and the banners are filled
                with too many contents. On the homepage, under the trusted brands, due to the different styling and fonts of partners logos, the elements gave a untidy outlook.</p>

                <p>The major elements such as the Banner, promotion elements and search key bar are appropriately positioned. However, it may not be advisable to group the login link together with all the other elements

                <p>The website may seems to have overuse in the colors on the homepage. The banner alone has many different colors while most pages have a combination of red, blue and green colours. It does not follow
                the use of corporate colours. Using corporate colours helps to identity of the organization but it is not necessary to strictly follow the corporate colours. Otherwise, color sense of this website design is
                good.</p>
